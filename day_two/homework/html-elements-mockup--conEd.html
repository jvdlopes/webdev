    <!-- Open up the mockup file to follow along with what the finished product would look like if we added CSS. Don't forget, we are only focusing on the HTML. That means that even though our website won't look visually similar to the mockup, structurally and semantically speaking, it will be identical! -->

    <!-- Follow along with the comments below to build out the mockup's HTML. -->

            <p>The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here.</p>

            <P>All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. Here's something that's fun. The least little bit can do so much. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important.</P>
